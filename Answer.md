ANSWER 1: The relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities is typically a one-to-many relationship, where one product can belong to only one product category, but a product category can have multiple products associated with it.

In the provided schema:

- The "Product" entity has a foreign key column named "category_id" that references the primary key column "id" of the "Product_Category" entity.
- This indicates that each product is associated with a specific category through the "category_id" column.
- In the "Product_Category" entity, there may be multiple rows representing different categories, each identified by a unique "id".
- By storing the "category_id" in the "Product" entity, it allows for efficient querying and organization of products based on their categories.

In essence, this relationship allows products to be grouped and organized into different categories for easier management, navigation, and analysis within the system.

ANSWER 2: 
To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you can use a foreign key constraint between the "category_id" column in the "Product" table and the "id" column in the "product_category" table
